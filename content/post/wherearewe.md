While trying to write a paper on strategy for Global Galaxy I wanted to illustrate how genomics becomes the unifying theme for all of the biological disciplines. Obviously genomics is not the first example of a common unifying theme in biology: evolutionary and population genetics as well as molecular biology have had a profound impact on all of the biological sciences. However, I needed a good historical account on previous "cross-cutting" events in biology. There is a number of good historical accounts of biology including:

 - [A history of life sciences](https://www.crcpress.com/A-History-of-the-Life-Sciences-Revised-and-Expanded/Magner/p/book/9780824708245) by Lois Magner;;
 - [A history of molecular biology](https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_of_Molecular_Biology.html?id=Qe93vz5ZLVsC) by Michel Morange;
 - [A history of genetics](http://www.esp.org/books/sturt/history/) by Alfred Sturtevant;
 - [Molecular genetics](https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Genetics-Introductory-Gunther-Stent/dp/0716700484) by Gunther Stent.

 However, while reading "A history of molecular biology" I came across a reference to Ernst Mayr's paper "[Where are we?](http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/24/1.short)" published in 1959. It was a remarkable reading that I decided to dissect in details below. Note that this article pre-dates many important developments in genetics such as papers by Lewontin from the early 60s.

## The Mendelian period

Mayr argues that [August Weismann's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Weismann) (also see [Churchill's book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674736894)) work on separation of somatic and germ cells as well as his writings difficulties with Lamarckian logic set the new framework for accepting and understanding Mendel's discovering made some 30 years earlier. The rediscovery of Mendel's laws by De Vries, Correns, Tschermak, and later Bateson gave rise to Mendelism. One of the overreaching ideas of this period was that evolution occurs in big leaps - so called saltationist thinking. Mays also quotes T. H. Morgan as saying that evolution occurs "due to occasional lucky mutants" and also points that Dobzhansky himself had a very similar view. As a result the first 20 years of the XXth century have seen a sharp divide between evolutionists and geneticists. Mayr then credits Schmidt, Sumner, and Goldschmidt with showing that the apparent differences between species are genetic. This in turn reconciled the differences between evolitionists and geneticists leading for genetic interpretation of evolution.

## Classical population genetics

It is interesting that Mays clearly defines two main schools of population genetics: Fisher, Wright, and Haldane on one hand and Sumner, Timofeeff-Ressonsky, and Dobzhansky on the other hand. The former was mathematical, while the latter was rooted in population systematics. As Mays points out this period was critical in establishing the importance of natural selection and preparing conceptual base for the analysis of quantitative characters. The initial numerical treatment of population dynamics required a number of unrealistic assumptions and simplification that become clear because of the work of experimental population geneticists. 

## The newer population genetics

The classical population genetics treated genes, notes Mayr, as beans in a bean bag. The new wave put emphasis on interaction of genes: 

> "Not only individuals but even populations were no longer described atomistically as aggregates of independent genes in various frequencies, but as integrated, coadapted complexes"

Mays then proceeds to ask an interesting (controversial) question of what is the real contribution of mathematical analysis and modeling developed by Fisher, Wright, and Haldane? One clear contribution is that they have put population genetics on the rigorous quantitative footing, but what is there beyond that? Mays points out that the relationship between allelic frequencies and genotypes has been worked much earlier (Hardy-Wienberg equation dates back to 1908) and that the concept of genetic drift surfaced as early as XIXthe century. Mays then turns around by saying that despite its simplifications the mathematical foundation laid by Fisher/Wright/Haldane was necessary for the development of modern population genetics.

## Contribution of genetics

In this section Mayr lays out fundamental contribution of genetics to the synthetic theory of evolution. 

> "Such an emphasis on history may be a wholesome counterweight against the exceedingly unhistorical attitude of our current age"

### Mutation

>"That generation of evolutionists, who associated with the term "mutation" what De Vries had meant by it, had to die off before the term could be reintroduced into the evolutionary theory in the broader meaning of later genetics."

Here Mays underscores the negative effect of the saltationist views of De Vries that suppressed the appreciation of the true role of mutations in evolution. He points out that the modern genetics re-established mutations as the source of an "ever-continuing origin of new genetic variation".

### Population

Mays states that the population thinking came into genetics from the work of taxonomists and mentions that the early population geneticists such as Dobzhansky and Sumner were naturalists (not quantitative biologists). 

### Natural selection

Mayr points out that early Mendelians were quite militantly anti-selectionist. 

### Genetic drift

It is interesting that the concept of genetic drift dates back to XIX century studies by [John Gulick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Gulick). Mayr points out that the principal contribution of Sewall Wright was to

> "... separate clearly the respective contributions which mutation pressure, accidents of sampling, and natural selection make to gene frequencies in populations of various sizes."

### Isolating mechanisms

This term was put forward by Dobzhansky himself.

### Geographic variation

Mays writes that the geographic variation was known for a very long (pre-Darwin) time and that the contributions of Schmidt, Sumner, and Goldschidt was in pointing out the geographic differences are explained by the same genetic underpinned as the differences between individuals in a population. This ultimately brought down of mutationism (saltationist ideas of De Vries) and Lamarckism.
