      <description>We take cloning vectors for given but most people do not know their history. I&#39;m one of these people. Yet because we use pBR322 extensively, I wanted to know its origins. This is a condensed version of that investigation. Stanley Cohen and co-workers (Cohen et al. 1973) constructed first functional plasmids by transforming E. coli with fragments produced by treating R6-5 and pSC101 plasmids using Eco RI restriction enzyme. They effectively showed that functional extrachromosomal replicons can be obtained by joining plasmid DNA of completely different origins.</description>
